# MJ's Technical Assesment (mj-jobjack-ta)

My technical assesment for JobJack. The date of the assesment ran between 29/30 September to the 3/4th October.

#### Problem Statement

1. Develop a Node.JS API that allows a client app to: Obtain the full directory listing of a given directory path on the local filesystem where the API is running. Include the filename, full path, file size, extension/file type and created date in the result and cater for a large directory size ( at least 100 000). Add the file permissions/attribute information to the results. Differentiate between a directory and file in the results. A directory should be selectable and update the results with the newly selected directory path. Make sure the application is containerized and can run on any system. REST or GraphQL can be used. We are a GraphQL company, but if you are unfamiliar with the subject matter, it is advisable that you use what you know best.
2. Build an Angular 8+ client that can call the api and display the results. It does not have to be fancy, you can use frameworks like bootstrap to display the data. Make sure the client display is responsive and looks good on most devices.
3. Try to stay away from imperative-style coding as much as possible. Stream is your partner. Submit this work on a GitHub / GitLab repo and share the repo.
