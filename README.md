# MJ's Technical Assesment (mj-jobjack-ta)

My technical assesment for JobJack. The date of the assesment ran between 29/30 September to the 3/4th October.

#### Summarized Problem Statement

1. Develop a Node.JS API (REST/GraphQL) that accepts a directory path (on the API's host system), use this path to obtain a full directory listing that includes the following:

   - filename
   - full file path
   - file size (KB)
   - extension
   - file type
   - created date
   - file permissions/attributes
   - is? file/directory

   Make sure a directory is selectable? and return new/updated results.

2. Build an Angular 8+ client that
   - calls the API
   - displays the results
   - make it responsive
   - use frameworks such as Bootstrap
